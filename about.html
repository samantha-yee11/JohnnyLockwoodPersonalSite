                     Johnny Buc Lockwood, or Coach Johnny, is dedicated to helping people and especially young people reach their goals.

                  <br>
                  <p>
                     Having lived a diverse life while pursuing a variety of academic, athletic, creative and entrepreneurial challenges for the past four decades, Johnny brings a no-nonsense approach to his coaching.  
                     Johnny has learned the value and importance of pursuing his dreams, setting goals, understanding and overcoming obstacles, while maintaining vision and direction.

                  <p> 
                     As a former troubled teen, Coach Johnny was assisted by a life coach and mentor who guided him from failing out of high school to achieving academic, athletic and personal success. 
                     Accepted at <a href="https://www.andover.edu/" target="_blank">Andover</a> after turning his wayward teen life around, Johnny was recruited to play varsity hockey and baseball at  <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Vermont</a>, where he graduated with a BA in English. A few years later he became a Research Fellow at The Institute of Politics at Harvard.

                  <p> 
                     Feeling restless with academia, Johnny ventured off to NYC to pursue his passions where he started a band and established a Wall Street-based wealth management business.  
                     He succeeded in both endeavours. His band signed a record contract and played in venues around the country, while his wealth management business attracted and worked with Forbes 400 clients.

                  <p>
                     The past few years, Coach Johnny has been dedicated to expanding the impact of <a href="https://go42.org/" target="_blank">The 42 Initiative</a>, a 501c3 non profit that he co founded with <a href="https://www.johnbranca.com/" target="_blank">John Branca</a>.  
                     The mission of The 42 Initiative is to bring together young students from all ethnic and economic backgrounds to participate together in Club 42 sports, esports, music and dance programs.
