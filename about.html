                  Johnny Buc Lockwood, or Coach Johnny, is dedicated to helping people and especially young people reach
                  their goals.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                  Having lived a diverse life while pursuing a variety of academic, athletic, creative and
                  entrepreneurial challenges for the past four decades, Johnny brings a no-nonsense approach to his
                  coaching.
                  Johnny has learned the value and importance of pursuing his dreams, setting goals, understanding and
                  overcoming obstacles, while maintaining vision and direction.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                  As a former troubled teen, Coach Johnny was assisted by a life coach and mentor who guided him from
                  failing out of high school to achieving academic, athletic and personal success.
                  Accepted at <a href="https://www.andover.edu/" target="_blank" class="aboutme">Andover</a> after turning his wayward
                  teen life around, Johnny was recruited to play varsity hockey and baseball at <a
                     href="https://www.uvm.edu/" target="_blank" class="aboutme">The University of Vermont</a>, where he graduated with
                  a BA in English. A few years later he became a Research Fellow at <a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" class="aboutme">The Institute of Politics at Harvard</a>.
                  
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                  Feeling restless with academia, Johnny ventured off to NYC to pursue his passions where he started a
                  band and established a Wall Street-based wealth management business.
                  He succeeded in both endeavours. His band signed a record contract and played in venues around the
                  country, while his wealth management business attracted and worked with Forbes 400 clients.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                  The past few years, Coach Johnny has been dedicated to expanding the impact of <a
                     href="https://go42.org/" target="_blank" class="aboutme">The 42 Initiative</a>, a 501c3 non profit that he co
                  founded with <a href="https://www.johnbranca.com/" target="_blank" class="aboutme">John Branca</a>.

                  backgrounds to participate together in Club 42 sports, esports, music and dance programs.
